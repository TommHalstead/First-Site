				<h2 class="title"> <i> Italicized </i> and <b> BOLD </b> words or sentences in paragraphs and headings.
				</h2>

			</fieldset>

			<p> The "Sup" tag is used for raising numbers for dates or mathematical concepts, for example: The
				5<sup>th</sup> of
				May is Cinco De Mayo which is known as superscript. The "Sub" tag is used for lowering numbers for
				chemicals
				or
				foot notes, for example: H<sub>2</sub>O, also known as subscript.
			<p>

			<fieldset class="titlefs">

				<h2 class="title"> White Space Collapsing, Line Breaks and Horizontal Rules </h2>

			</fieldset>

			<p> Whtie Space Collapsing means that when typing code into HTML, the computer will not recognize more than
				one
				space when paired together with another space.

			<h5><b><i>CHECK THE CODING ^</i></b></h5>

			<br>If you do wish to break a line,</br> the &#60br&#62 tag is used.
			</p>

			<hr />

			<p> The &#60hr /&#62 tag is used in order to create a horizontal line splitting two opposing views or pools
				of
				information etc. it is unique in the way that it is an "Empty Element" and is one of few tags that only
				has
				one
				tag and is used with no letters or words in between, it is &#60hr /&#62
			</p>

				<h2 class="title">Content Mangement Systems and Semantic Markup</h2>

			</fieldset>

			<p>Content Management Systems such as Dreamweaver simplify writing codes with many shortcuts to streamline
				the
				process of writing many tedious tags or elements etc. </p>

			<blockquote id="marcus">
				<p>"For nothing is so conducive to spiritual growth as this capacity for logical and accurate analysis
					of
					everything
					that
					happens to us." - Marcus Aurelius</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p id="semantic"><em>Semantic Markup do not affect the structure of the webpage but instead adds extra
					information to the
					pages</em> the &#60em&#62 tag shows words or paragraphs in italics, but should not be used to
				italicize
				words but to show where emphasis should be added in a sentence. Similarly the &#60blockquote&#62 tag
				will
				show
				everything in-between the tags italicized as well but should only be used to show when a sentence or
				paragraph
				is quoted from another source. </p>

			<fieldset class="titlefs">

				<h2 class="title">Strong and Emphasis and Quoatations.</h2>

			</fieldset>

			<p>The <strong> &#60strong&#62 </strong> tag is used to show importance to a word or sentence and naturally
				makes it
				<b>BOLD</b>
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>Using the &#60blockquote&#62 tag will indent the section naturally but should not be used for that,
					rather
					CSS should be used for styling affects, instead the &#60blockquote&#62 should be used to quote and
					cite
					information from another site or author. </p>

			</blockquote>
			<p> The &#60q&#62 tag is used to <q>Quote smaller sentences where the &#60blockquote&#62 tag is not
					necessary</q>
				although, Internet Explorer doesn't display the "" around the quote as it should, so peopld tend to
				avoid
				using
				the &#60q&#62 tag</p>

			<fieldset class="titlefs">
				<h2 class="title">Abbreviations, Acronyms, Citations and Definitions</h2>

			</fieldset>

			<p>Both abbreviations and acronyms use the &#60abbr&#62 tag, although a <i>title</i> attribute must be used
				in
				order
				to specify the full term while hovering over the <abbr title="Abbreviation">&#60abbr&#62</abbr>
				abbbreviation.
				The same goes for acronyms, such as <acronym>
					title="National Austonauts and Space Administration">NASA</acronym> which is completed with the
				&#60acronym&#62 tag</p>

			<p>The &#60cite&#62 tag is used when citing where a specific piece of work such as a book, movie or research
				paper
				comes from, for example:<cite>A Brief History of Time</cite> by <b>Stephen Hawkings</b> has sold over
				ten
				million copies worldwide. The &#60cite&#62 tag will also <i>italicize</i> everything in-between the
				brackets
				for
				the tag</p>

			<p>The &#60dfn&#62 tag is used when a new or unknown term is introduced for the first time, in other words,
				it's
				the
				defining instance for a new term. A <dfn title="Location animals rehydrate at">Watering Hole</dfn> is a
				location
				in which animals or livestock drink water, most browsers show everything in the &#60dfn&#62 tag in
				<i>italicized,</i> although Safari does not. The "tite" subtag can also be embedded within the
				&#60dfn&#62
				tag
				in order to give extra explanation.
			</p>

			<fieldset class="titlefs">

				<h2 class="title">Author Details and Changes to Content</h2>

			</fieldset>

			<p>The &#60address&#62 tag is used very specifically. It's used to give contact details for the author of a
				post
				or
				cited material, it's meant for a physical addresss, but instead can be an email address or phone number
				even. An
				&#60a href&#62 must be used in order to link to another HTML website, also called an anchor tag. <a
					href="mailto:tommy.halstead2@gmail.com">tommy.halstead2@gmail.com</a> which is closed by using an
				&#60a&#62
				tag. </p>

			<p>The &#60ins&#62 tag can be used to underline words, or to show content that has been inserted into a
				<ins>webpage</ins> or <ins>document</ins> on the other hand, the &#60del&#62 tag can be used to show
				words
				that
				have been <del>deleted</del> or in other words have a <del>line</del> through them.
			</p>

			<p>The &#60s&#62 tag is used to slash out a word that is no longer valid or inaccurate information but not
				to be
				deleted. <s>The &#60u&#62 tag is used to underline words, sentences or paragraphs.</s> but is being
				phased
				out

				<h2 class="title">Ordered Lists, Unordered Lists, Definition lists and Nested Lists. </h2>

			</fieldset>

			<h4><b>How to Create an Ordered List.</b></h4>

			<ol>
				<li>The &#60ol&#62 tag is used when creating an ordered list, around the whole list.</li>
				<li>The &#60li&#62 tag is used for each the tag around each item or whatever it may be on the list.</li>
				<li>Ordered Lists are austomatically indented in HTML5</li>
				<li>CSS is used in order to change the standard 1-2-3 list into roman numerals, letters and so on.</li>
			</ol>


			<h4><b>How to Create an Unordered List.</b></h4>

			<ul>
				<li>The Unordered List is compromised of the &#60ul&#62 tag, exacty as you would expect. </li>
				<li>Ordered and Unordered lists both contain the &#60li&#62 tag for the listed items.</li>
				<li>As with the Ordered lists, Unordered lists are also indented automatically by the browser.</li>
				<li>You may sometimes see a <i>type</i> attribute used with the &#60ul&#62 tag to specify Bullet points,
					Diamonds, Circles, Squares and so on, but this should be done with CSS and will be covered in this
					book.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h4><b>How to Create a Defintion List.</b></h4>

			<dl>
				<dt><i>Ordered List</i></dt>
				<dd>A numbered list, CSS can be used to change the numbers into Roman numerals, letters and more. </dd>
				<dt><i>Unordered List</i></dt>
				<dd>A unordered list is a list with no numbers but rather bullet points, diamonds, squares, circles and
					more
					which can be created with the type attribute but should be done with CSS</dd>
				<dt><i>Definition List</i></dt>
				<dd>A definition list is exactly this, a list created with the &#60dl&#62 tag to contain the list
					itself, a
					&#60dt&#62 tag to contain the term to be defined or definition term, and finally a &#60dd&#62 tag
					with
					brackets and in lower case of course to define the above listed term.</dd>
			</dl>

			<h4><b>How to create a Nested List</b></h4>

			<ul>
				<li>Unordered List</li>
				<li>Nested Lists
					<ul>
						<li>The &#60ul&#62 or &#60ol&#62 tag is used for a nested list, with the &#60ul&#62 tag, the
							parent
							list
							will typically be in bullet points with hollow bullet points for the nested list. </li>
						<li>The &#60li&#62 tag is typical for both ordered and unordered lists</li>
						<li>When starting a nested list, the &#60li&#62 tag will be under another unordered list tag
							&#60ul&#62
							and will closed before the &#60li&#62 tag used to start the nested list. </li>

				<h2 class="title">Writing Links with the &lta&gt tag</h2>

			</fieldset>

			<h3><b>There are 5 covered types of links in this section</b></h3>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Links from one website to another</b>
					<ul>
						<li>All links have an &#60a href&#62 attribute, the value of the href attribute is where you
							want
							people
							to go when they click the link.
						<li><a href="www.google.com">Google.com</a></li>
						<li>URL stand for Uniform Resource Locator. An URL starts with the domain name for that site,
							and
							can be
							followed by the path to a specific page. If no page is specified in the code, it will
							display
							the
							homepage.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Links from one page to another on the same website</b>
					<ul>
						<li>When linking to pages within the same website, you do not need to specify the domain name in
							the
							URL
							since you're already on the domain, you can use what's called shorthand or relative URL. The
							folders
							for the linked pages must be in the same folder as the rest of the domain for it to work
							correctly.
							If they aren't in the same folder, there is a slightly more complex syntax covered later on.
						<li><a href="C:\Users\tommy\Documents\Coding\First webpage HTML&CSS">Home</a></li>
					</ul>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Links from one part of a web page to another part of the same page</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Links to pages in the same folder are simple, just name the folder location to be linked,
							for
							example: &#60a href="index.html">HOME&#60/a&#62</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Links that open in a new browser window</b>
					<ul>
						<li>To create a link that opens your desired location in a new window, you can use the
							<i>target</i>
							attribute within the &#60a&#62 tag. The value should be <i>_blank</i> </li>
						<li>One reason you may want open a link in a new tab is so the user will hopefully return back
							to
							your
							website once they're finished with the linked website. </li>
						<li>An example of the above stated code is as follows: &#60a href="www.google.com"
							target="_blank"><b>Open the webpage</b>&#60/a&#62</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Links that start up your email program and address a new email to someone</b>
					<ul>
						<li>To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a
							specified
							email
							address, you use the &#60a&#62 tag but the &#60a href&#62 attribute starts with &#60a
							href="mailto:tommy.m.halstead@gmail.com">Email Tommy&#60/a&#62</li>
						<li>An example of the code displayed above is as following: <a
								href="mailto:tommy.m.halstead@gmail.com">Email Tommy</a>
						</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Linking to a specific part of the same page</b>
					<ul>
						<li>If you have a long webpage, you may want to have links to specific content or locations for
							ease
							of
							use on the website. In order to do this you must identify the parts of the page the link
							will go
							to,
							this is done with the <i>id </i>attribute (which can be used on every HTML element).</li>
						<li>The value of the <i>id</i> attribute should always start with a letter or underscore, never
							a
							number
							or special character. No same two values or locations may be used on one webpage.</li>
						<li>To link to an element that uses an <i>id </i>attribute you use the &#60a&#62 tag, only this
							time
							the
							value of the &#60h ref&#62 attribute starts with the # symbol, followed by the specified
							name of
							the
							<i>id</i> attribute or named location you want to link to.
							(<em>Example at the bottom, view page source in order to view)</em>
						</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Linking to a specific part of another page.</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Linking to a specific part of another webpage is very similar to linking to a specific part
							of
							the
							same page. As long as you have the correct identifying code for the part of the page you
							would
							like
							to link to, you just add the webpage URL to the &#60h ref&#62 attribute followed by the #
							symbol,
							followed by the value of the <i>id attribute.</i>
						<li>For example, &#60a href="http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/#bottom"&#62

			<h2 class="title">Adding images and everything that comes with it through HTML</h2>

		</fieldset>

		<p>In order to add an image to the webpage, you use the &#60img&#62 tag accompanied by the &#60src&#62 tag and =
			sign in order to specify the grabbing location of the image. The &#60alt&#62 tag follows the &#60src&#62 tag
			in
			order to give a word explanation of the image for read to text purposes and should always be used even if
			the
			photo is used purely to make the page more attractive, just with empty quotes.</p>

		<p>The code for adding an image to a webpage is as follows: &#60img src=<i>"image location"</i> Relative URL for
			the
			img file.jpg"</i>
			alt="<i>Text to read and the disabled description</i>" title="<i>Descriptive Statement for the image</i>"
			/&#62

			<br />
			<p>
			<figcaption id="caption">The &#60figure&#62 element is used to contain an image and its contents or captions
				so
				that the
				website knows the two are associated. The &#60figcaption&#62 element is used in order to specify the
				caption
				for an image, which will be located under the picture as viewed here.

				<h2 class="title">Basic Table Structure, Table Headings, Spanning Columns and Spanning Rows</h2>

			</fieldset>

			<p>When creating tables, the &#60table&#62 tag is used to specify a table will be following in the next
				code,
				the
				(table row) &#60tr&#62 tag is used to create each individual table row and must be closed off with
				&#60/tr&#62
				tag after each item in the columns (table data) &#60td&#62 </p>


			<h4>Standard/Basic table coding:</h4>

			<table class="minortable">

			</table>


			<p>The &#60th&#62 element is used just like the &#60td&#62 tag, but it's purpose is to represent the heading
				for
				either
				a cloumn or a row. The &#60th&#62 tag stands for table heading. Even when a cell has no content or
				information,
				the
				tags should still be in place in order for the table to render correctly.</p>

			<p>The &#60th&#62 element is also used for people who use screen readers. It also improves search engines
				abilities
				to
				index your pages in order for websites to queue your website faster. As well as it makes styling with
				CSS
				much
				easier. The scope element can be used to specify whether it's a column or row. (Browsers typically show
				the
				content
				of the &#60th&#62 element in bold and in the center of the cell.) </p>

			<p>When creating some specific time tables or other types of graphs, you may need the coding to span more
				one
				row or
				column, in order to do this you use the &#60scope&#62 element.</p>

			<p>With longer tables or graphs, you should specify the heading, body, and footer. The header is specified
				with
				the
				&#60thead&#62 element, the body is specified with the &#60tbody&#62 element and the footer is specified
				with
				the
				&#60&#62 element. (By default browsers rarely treat the content of these elements any differently than
				other
				browsers but CSS is often used to change their appearance.) </p>

			<p>Another reason to specify long graphs with a header, body and footer is that that if the table is longer
				than
				the
				screen or page (if printed out) the header, some of the body content and table scroll and the fotter
				will
				all be
				shown.</p>

				<h2 class="title">Forms, Form Controls, Form Structures, Everything Forms</h2>

			</fieldset>

			<ul>
				<b>Forms created to add text to forms:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Text Input
					<li>Password Input</li>
					<li>Text Area</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>

			<p>The most known and most used form on the internet is probably the Google searchbox, forms provide many
				functions
				for searching, inputing information, online shopping, signing up for newspapers etc.</p>

			<p>There are multiple types of forms as stated before. There is <i>text input</i> or single line forms,
				typically
				used for emails or names and possibly addresses. Next there are <i>password input</i> forms which are
				the
				same
				as single line <i>text input</i> but it masks the text entered. Next there are <i>text area</i> forms,
				which
				are
				multi-line forms typically used for message or comment sections.</p>

			<ul>
				<b>Forms created for making choices:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Radio Buttons
					<li>Checkboxes</li>
					<li>Drop-Down Boxes</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>

			<p><i>Radio buttons</i> are used when a user must select one of a number of options (which cannot be used to
				select
				multiple options).<i>Checkboxes</i> are used so a user can select and unselect one or more options.
				Finally,
				<i>Drop-Down Boxes</i> are applied when a user must select one a number of options from a list.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<b>Forms created in order to submit information:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Submit Buttons
					<li>Image Buttons</li>
					<li>File Upload</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>

			<p>When webpages need a slot for users to submit information, a <i>submitting form</i> is used. The three
				types
				of
				submitting forms are <i>Submit Buttons</i>, which are used to submit information from your form to
				another
				web
				page.
				<i>Image Buttons</i>, are similar to <i>submit buttons</i> but instead allows you to use an image in
				place
				of
				the
				standard
				submit button. Lastly, <i>File Upload</i> forms allow users to upload a file(s) to a webpage. Whether it
				be
				an
				image
				or another sort of file.
			</p>

			<h4>How a form works:</h4>

			<ol>
				<li>The user fills in form data and presses a button to submit the information to the server.</li>
				<li>The name of each form control is sent over to the server, along with the value of the users entries.
				</li>
				<li>The server processes the information with a programming language such as PHP, C#, VB.net, or Java.
					It
					may
					also
					store the entered information in a database for security and data keeping reasons.</li>
				<li>Lastly, the server careates a webpage to send back to the browser based on the useres selected
					options
					or
					information recieved. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>In order to differentiate between various pieces of information which may be contained in a form,
				information
				is
				sent
				to the server in a <i>Name/Value</i> pairs. If the form is one which allows the user to enter text, the
				the
				value of
				the form control is whatever the user has typed in. If the form control allows you to choose from a
				fixed
				set of
				answers (e.g. radio buttons, checkboxes, and drop-down boxes) then, the webpage author will add code
				that
				gives
				each
				option an automatic value. (Never change the name of a form control on a webpage unless you know the
				changed
				name is
				coded into the website previously as an option.) </p>

			<h4>Form Structure</h4>

			<p>The &#60form&#62 element is used to specify a form and is always used with the <i>action</i> attribute
				and
				will
				usually have a <i>method</i> and <i>id attribute</i> as well. Every &#60form&#62 elemt must carry an
				<i>action</i>
				attribute as previously stated. The value of the <i>action</i> attribute is the URL on the server of
				which
				you
				would
				like the information submitted to.
			</p>

			<p>Forms can be sent using one of the two methods: <i>get</i> or <i>post</i>. With the <i>get</i> method,
				the
				values
				of
				the form are added to the end of the URL specified in the <i>action</i> attribute (which is also where
				you
				would
				like the information submitted sent to.) The <i>get</i> method is best for:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Short forms (such as search boxes, emails, names etc.)</li>
				<li>When you are using the form strictly to recieve data from the web server. (Not for sending
					information
					to a
					database that should be added or deleted from the database.)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The <i>post</i> method are sent in what are known as HTTP headers. As a rule of thumb, you should use the
				<i>post</i>
				method for the following reasons and or applications:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The <i>post</i> method allows users to upload a file.</li>
				<li>If the form is very long, the <i>post</i> method should be used.</li>
				<li>If the form contains sensitive data, such as passwords or other protected personal information.</li>
				<li>If the form is being utilized to add or remove information from a database, then the <i>post</i>
					method
					should
					be used.</li>
			</ul>

			<form action="http://127.0.0.1:3000/index.html" method="get">
				<p>This is where the form controls will appear.</p>
			</form>

			<p>The <i>size</i> attribute was previously before CSS used to indicate the width of the text input box
				itself.
				(But
				is no longer used because of CSS) For example: </p>

			<br />

			<p>&#60form action="http://127.0.0.1:3000/index.html" method="get"&#62
				&#60p&#62This is where the form controls will appear.&#60/p&#62
				&#60input type="text" name="username" size="15" maxlength="30" /&#62
			</p>
			</form>

			<h4>This is an example of a simple text input form:</h4>

			<fieldset class="inputform1">
				<legend>Enter your Username below:</legend>
				<form action="http://127.0.0.1:3000/index.html" method="get">

					<textarea name="Comments" cols="20" rows="4">Enter your comments here...</textarea>

				</form>

			</fieldset>


			<p>Unlike other input methods, &#60textarea&#62 is not an empty element, which means it must have an opening
				and closing tag. Any text inbetween the opening &#60textarea&#62 tag and closing &#60/textarea&#62 tag
				will be shown in the text box when the page loads.</p>

			<p>If the user does not delete the text between these tags shown on the webpage, this message will get sent
				to the server along with whatever answer or reply the user has typed. (Some sites use JavaScript to
				clear this information when the user clicks in the text area.)</p>
			</form>

			<hr />
			<h4>This is an example of Radio Buttons:</h4>

			<form action="http://127.0.0.1:3000/index.html">
				<p>Select your favorite dog breed from the 3 displayed options below:
					<br />
					<br />
					<input type="radio" name="dog breed" value="german shepherd" /> German Shepherd
					<input type="radio" name="dog breed" value="toy maltipoo" checked="checked" /> Toy Maltipoo
					<input type="radio" name="dog breed" value="husky" /> Husky
				</p>
			</form>

			<p>When creating Radio Button forms, the <i>name</i> attribute is sent to the server with the value of the
				option
				selected by the user. When using the <i>name</i> attribute in radio button forms, the value should be
				the
				same for
				all input type options.</p>

			<p>The <i>value</i> attribute is the value of the option that has been selected which is sent to the server.
				The
				actual
				value or option you would like the user to see is typed out after the closing parentheses. </p>

			<p>You can use the &#60checked&#62 attribute to indicate which value (if you so choose) is checked upon
				someone
				loading
				up the webpage for the first time. <em>Once the radio button has been selected, it cannot be deselected,
					only a
					seperate option may be chosen at this point.</em></p>

			<hr />
			<h4>This is an example of Checkbox Forms:</h4>

			<form action="http://127.0.0.1:3000/index.html">
				<p>Select your favorite internet browser below:
				</p>

				<input type="checkbox" name="browser" value="Google Chrome" /> Google Chrome
				<input type="checkbox" name="browser" value="Microsoft Edge" /> Microsoft Edge
				<input type="checkbox" name="browser" value="Shitternet Explorer" /> Shitternet Explorer
				</p>
				<p>The main difference between between radio buttons and checkbox forms is that checkbox forms can be
					selected and deselected.</p>
			</form>

			<hr />
			<h4>Drop Down List Box Forms:</h4>

			<form action="http://127.0.0.1:3000/index.html">
				<p>What device do you listen to music on mostly?</p>
				<select name="devices">
					<option value="phone" >Phone</option>
					<option value="ipod" > Ipod</option>
					<option value="car speaker" >MP3</option>
				</select>
			</form>

			<p>The &#60select&#62 element is used to create a drop down list box (also known as a select box), it
				contains
				two or more &#60option&#62
				elements and is
			</p>
			<p>The <i>name</i> attribute, similar to all other forms covered so far is to specify to the name of
				the form control being sent to the server, along wth the value the user selected.
			</p>
			<p>The &#60option&#62 element is used to specify the options that the use can select from. The words
				in-between
				the opening and closing &#60option&#62 tag are what will be shown in the drop down box.
			</p>
			<p>The <i>selected</i> attribute is similar to the &#60checked&#62 tag in the way that it is utilized to
				have a
				pre determined selected option when the page is loaded. If there is no chosen or coded selected option,
				then
				the first item written in the code will be displayed when the page is loaded.
			</p>
			<p>The function of a down down box is so in case you have a long list of options so users can scroll through
				the
				available options, (Countries for instance). The function of a radio buttons is to have a few options
				that
				users may need to see all the available options at once (say quiz answers).
			</p>

			<hr />
			<h4>Multiple Select Box Forms:</h4>
			<form action="http://127.0.0.1:3000/index.html">
				<p>Which of the following brand(s) do you own? (You can only select more than one option by holding down
					<i>ctrl</i> on Windows and <i>command</i> on Mac.
				</p>
				<select name="brands" size="4" multiple="multiple">

					<option value="nike">Nike</option>
					<option value="adidas" selected="selected">Adidas </option>
					<option value="vans">Vans</option>
					<option value="gucci">Gucci</option>
				</select>
			</form>

			<p>Multiple select boxes are created exactly the same way as a drop down box, with the difference between
				the
				two being that the <i>size</i> attribute is used in order to show how many items in the drop down box
				you
				would like the user to be able to see without scrolling down the list. Although as previously stated, on
				a
				Windows computer the <i>ctrl</i> button must be used to select multiple options and the <i>command</i>
				button. </p>

			<hr />
			<h4>File Input Box:</h4>

			<form action="http://127.0.0.1:3000/index.html" methoed="post">
				<p>Upload your song in MP3 format:
				</p>

				<input type="file" name="user-song" />
				<br />
				<input type="submit" value="Upload" />
				</p>
				<p>The main difference between between radio buttons and checkbox forms is that checkbox forms can be
					selected and deselected.</p>
				<p> The value for the <i>type</i> attribute for a file input box is always set to "file" and will
					automatically contain the "browse" button included, (which the styling of cannot be changed) into
					the
					file value.</p>

				<p>When you are allowing users to upload a file, the mehtod attribute used on the &#60form&#62 element
					must
					have a value of <i>post.</i> When the browse button is clicked the display box will be chosen by the
					operating system and cannot be changed. </p>
			</form>

			<hr />

			<h4>Submit Button Form:</h4>

			<div class="submit">

				<form action="http://127.0.0.1:3000/index.html">
					<p>Subscribe to our email list:</p>
					<input type="text" name="email" placeholder="Email Address" />
					<input type="submit" name="subscribe" value="Subscribe" />
				</form>

			</div>

			<p> Submit button forms can contain a name attribute but do not require one. The <i>value</i> attribute is
				used
				to control the text that appears on a submit button form. It's a good idea to change the text on the
				submit
				button because some websites default the text to "submit query" which may not be applicable to all types
				of
				forms. Again, CSS is used to style and change the buttons and their styling if possible.
			</p>

			<hr />

			<h4>Image Button Form:</h4>

			<form action="http://127.0.0.1:3000/index.html">
				<p>Subscribe to our email list:</p>
				<input type="text" name="email" placeholder="Email Address" />
				<input type="image" src="\subscribe.gif" width="100" heigh="20" />

			</form>

			<p>You can set the width and heigh with an image button form which can also be done with CSS. (Make sure to
				save
				and download the image or gif or whatever it may be in the same size format as you would like to use in
				your
				coding or your document to prevent image stabilty and quality errors.)</p>

			<hr />

			<h4>Button and Hidden Controls:</h4>

			<form action="http://127.0.0.1:3000/index.html">
				<button><img src="/Add.png" alt="add" width="24" height="24" />Add</button>
				<input type="hidden" name="bookmark" value="lyrics" />
			</form>

			<p>The &#60button&#62 element is used to add more control how buttons appear inside the &#60button&#62 tags.
				This means you can combine image and text between the opening and closing tags. </p>

			<p>This form also shows <i>type="hidden"</i> form control. These form controls are not shown on the webpage
				to
				the average user, but are shown if the page is inspected. They allow you to add values to forms that the
				user cannot see. For example, a web page author might use a hidden field to indidcate which page the
				user
				was on when they submitted a form.</p>

			<hr />

			<h4>Labelling and Form Controls:</h4>

			<label>Age: <input type="text" name="age" placeholder="Enter Age Here" />
			</label>
			<br />
			<span class="radio">Gender:</span>
			<input id="female" type="radio" name="gender" value="f">
			<label for="female">Female</label>
			<input id="male" type="radio" name="gender" vale="m">
			<label for="male">Male</label>
			<input id="not listed" type="radio" name="gender" vale="nl">
			<label for="not listed">Not Listed</label>

			<p>The &#60label&#62 tag should be used in every form, and has only been introduced now to keep the learning
				of
				the forms simple. It's used to aid vision-impaired users. The &#60label&#62 tag can be used in one of
				two
				ways:
			<ol>
				<li>Wrap around both the text and description and the form input (as shown on the first line above).
				</li>
				<li>Be kept seperate from the form control and use the <i>for</i> attribute to indicate which form
					control
					it is a label for (as shown with the radio buttons above).</li>
			</ol>
			</p>
			<p>The <i>for</i> attribute states which form control the label belongs to. The value of the <i>id
					attribute</i>
				uniquely identifies an element from all other elements on a page. The value of the <i>for</i> attribute
				matches that of the <i>id attribute</i> on the form control such as <i>input id</i> that it is being
				used to
				identify.
			</p>

			<p>When a &#60label&#62 element is used with a radio or checkbox, users may click either the form control
				(the
				actual radio button or checkbox itself) or the label (the wording for the form control). This extra
				clickable makes the form itself easier and less frustrating to use. The positioning of the label is very
				important. If users do not know where to enter information or what information is needed, they are much
				less
				likely to enter the form information correctly.
			</p>


			<p>As a rule of thumb, here are the best places or locations to place labels on form controls:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>As a rule of thumb, these types of form controls should be located <b>ABOVE AND TO THE LEFT</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Text Inputs</li>
						<li>Text Areas</li>
						<li>Select Boxes</li>
						<li>File Uploads</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li>These types of form controls should be located to the <b>RIGHT</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Individual Checkboxes</li>
						<li>Individual Radio Buttons</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<hr />

			<h4>Grouping Form Elements:</h4>

			<p>You can group a form set or form contrl with an outline and using the &#60fieldset&#62 element. The
				&#60legend&#62 element can be used in order give a text description of what the purpose of the outlined
				form
				control is for. An example is seen below: </p>

			<fieldset class="inputform1">
				<legend>Enter Your details below</legend>
				<label>Age: <input type="text" name="age" required="required" />
				</label>
				<br />
				Gender:
				<input id="female" type="radio" name="gender" value="f">
				<label for="female">Female</label>
				<input id="male" type="radio" name="gender" vale="m">
				<label for="male">Male</label>
				<input id="not listed" type="radio" name="gender" vale="nl">
				<label for="not listed">Not Listed</label>
				<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
			</fieldset>

			<p><em>Again as for styling of the webpage, fonts, texts, colors this border and fieldset tag can and will
					be
					styled and changed with CSS.</em></p>

			<hr />

			<h4>Form Validation:</h4>

			<div class="valid">

				<p class="valid1">If when typing information into a form and get an error message, this is form
					validation.
					Most modern day
					form validation is done with Javascript, but can be done with HTML5 as well.</p>

				<p class="valid2">Form validation helps ensure that the user enters information in a way that the server
					will
					be able to
					process, which creates less work for the server to do and enables users to see if there are problems
					with
					the form faster than if validation were performed on the server. An example of HTML5 form validation
					is
					the
					<i>required</i> attribute, which can be used on any form that the user is expected to fill in.
				</p>

			</div>

			<hr />

			<h4>Date, Email and URL Input:</h4>

			<div class="inputs">

				<h5>Date Input:</h5>

				<p>The <i>input</i> attribute can be paired together with the <i>type</i> attribute and make many
					options
					with
					forms. When making a form with a date for the user to select, the following is example of the code
					needed to
					create a date form (&#60input type="date"&#62). The format for the date box will be chosen by the
					users
					current browser. </p>

				<form action="http://127.0.0.1:3000/index.html">
					<label for="birth date">Birth Date:</label>
					<input type="date" name="birth date" />
				</form>

				<h5>Email Input:</h5>

				<form action="http://127.0.0.1:3000/index.html">
					<p class="inputsp">Enter your Email Address:</p>
					<label input for="email address"></label>
					<input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Enter your Email Address" />
					<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
				</form>



				<p>With the <i>email</i> attribute, there will be automatic form vaildation (the browser checking for
					the @
					sign) and some smartphones will autmatically use a keyboard with email address typing shortcuts.</p>



				<h5>URL Input:</h5>

				<form action="http://127.0.0.1:3000/index.html">
					<p class="inputsp">Enter Website Address below:</p>
					<input type="url" name="website" placeholder="Website Address" />
					<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
				</form>

				<p>Just like with the <i>email</i> attribute, there will be automatic validation when using the
					<i>url</i>
					attribute, the text box will require a URL to be entered.</p>


				<h5>Search Input:</h5>

				<form action="http://127.0.0.1:3000/index.html">
					<p class="inputsp">Search Here</p>
					<input type="search" name="search" placeholder="Enter Keywords" />

					<input type="submit" value="Search" />
				</form>

				<p>If you want to create a single line text box for search queries, HTML5 provides a special type of
					input
					for
					that purpose. To create a search query, the &#60input&#62 element should have a <i>type</i>
					attribute
					whose
					value is <i>search</i>.</p>

				<p>Older browsers, or even ones such as Google Chrome will simply show the search query box as a single
					line
					text box. Recent browsers add some features that improve usability. Safari on a Mac adds a cross to
					clear
					the search box when you have started to enter information. Safari also automatically rounds the
					corners
					on
					the search input box.</p>

				<p>On <b>ANY</b> text input, you can use a <i>placeholder</i> attribute in which the value will be shown
					in
					the
					text box until the user click or type in the box.</p>

					<legend><b>Doctypes</b></legend>
					<p>Because there has been several versions of HTML, EVERY SINGLE webpage must start with a
						&#60!DOCTYPE&#62 element to specify what code the document was written in.</p>

					<p>The declaration for HTML5 is simply &#60!DOCTYPE html&#62 which again, must be used on every
						single
						webpage created. A &#60!DOCTYPE&#62 declaration does not need a closing tag. The element is also
						case in-sensitive.</p>

				</fieldset>

				<fieldset>
					<legend><b>Comments within your code</b></legend>

					<p>You can leave comments in your code that the user cannot see, this is done by: &#60!--Write your
						code
						here--&#62</p>

					<p>It's a good idea to write comments in your code becuse no matter how familiar you are with it at
						the
						time, if you need to come back to change anything or if someone else were to go in and edit your
						code, it will make it easier either way. The normal user cannot see your comments on the visible
						page unless the user were to view the source code behind the page. On a long page, you will
						typically see comments used to indicate where sections of the page start or end, or for notes to
						help explain the code. Comments can also be used around blocks of code to stop that code from
						showing in the brower.</p>
					<!--Why am I only learning this now? lol-->
				</fieldset>

				<fieldset>
					<legend><b>Id Attribute</b></legend>

					<p>Any HTML element can carry the <i>id attribute</i> it is used to uniquely identify that element
						from
						ALL other elements on the page (therefore no two elements can carry the same value for the <i>id
							attribute</i>)</p>

					<p>The <i>id attribute</i> is also used by CSS to style a specific element differently than any
						other
						element on the page. Javascript also uses the <i>id attribute</i> to add interactivity to your
						webpages. The <i>id attribute</i> is a <b>Global Element</b>, meaning it can be used on
						any
						element.</p>
				</fieldset>

				<fieldset>
					<legend><b>Class Attribute</b></legend>

					<p>Every HTML element can also carry the <i>class</i> attribute. Rather than uniquely identifying
						one
						single element, you can use the <i>class</i> attribute to identify several elements from being
						different than all the others on the page. You may want to have some paragraphs of text that
						contain
						imformation that is more important than others and the <i>class</i> attribute is the way to do
						that.
						Or you can use the <i>class</i> attribute to differentiate between links that link to other
						pages on
						your webpage or from links that link to external websites.</p>

					<p class="important"> In order to do this, you use the <i>class</i> attribute. Its value is the
						class
						that it belongs to. The <i>class</i> attribute can share the same value as others, so the class
						value of "important" used on this paragragh could also be used on many other elements as well,
						such
						as headings and links.</p>

					<p>By default, using these attributes doesn't change the appearance of an element unless CSS is
						implemented to indicate that the presentation should be changed. For example, you could use CSS
						to
						make all elements with the value of "important" to be uppercase. You can indicate an element
						belongs
						to several classes by seperating the class value with a space. </p>

					<legend><b>Inline Elements</b></legend>

					<p>Inline elements will always continue to appear on the same line as their neighboring elements,
						these
						are known as inline elements. A few examples of inline elements are as follows:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>&#60a&#62</li>
						<li>&#60b&#62</li>
						<li>&#60img&#62</li>
						<li>&#60i&#62</li>
					</ul>
				</fieldset>

				<fieldset>
					<legend><b>Grouping Text and Elements in a Block</b></legend>

					<p>The &#60div&#62 element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.
						You can use the &#60div&#62 element to contain all of the elements used to create the header for
						your site, (the logo, navigation etc)or you could use the &#60div&#62 element to contain all of
						the comments from visitors. Or almost any particular part of a page you would like to be able to
						style with CSS.</p>

					<p>Nothing changes in a browser from using the &#60div&#62 element except the contents of it will
						start on a new line. It's important to use comments on your closing &#60div&#62 tags since there
						may be several other elements inside a &#60div&#62 element.</p>

					<p>However, we can throw in a <i>id</i> or <i>class</i> attribute on the &#60div&#62 element and
						that makes it so you can create CSS style rules to indicate how much space the &#60div&#62
						element should take up on the screen and change the appearance of all the elements contained
						within it. It can also make it easier to follow your code when and if you have used the
						&#60div&#62 element to hold or contain each part of the page.</p>

					<legend><b>Grouping Text and Elements Inline</b></legend>

					<p>The &#60span&#62 element is an inline equivalent of the &#60div&#62 element. It's typically
						either used for the following few actions:</p>



					<ol>
						<li>Contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from
							its surrounding text. </li>

						<li>Contain a number of inline elements.</li>

					</ol>

					<p>The most common reason why people use the & #60span&#62 element is so specific elements can be
						styled through CSS, and therefore will have a <i>class</i> or <i>id</i> tag. The <i>id</i> or
						<i>class</i> tag can be used to explain the purpose of the &#60span&#62 element.

						<legend><b>Information about your webpages and Escape Characters</b></legend>

						<p>The &#60meta&#62 element lives inside the &#60head&#62 element, it contains information about
							the webpage that the server uses to find your webpage with keywords, as well as who created
							it, and whether or not it's a time sensitive page. Users do not see the metadata but the
							keywords used are matched. It uses the attributes to carry this information.</p>

						<p>The most common attributes used with the &#60meta&#62 element are <i>name</i> and
							<i>content</i> attributes. The value or content of the <i>name</i> attribute used within the
							&#60meta&#62 element is the descrptive text for the <i>content</i> attribute, so therefore
							the <i>content</i> attribute will have an actual description. The <i>description</i>
							attribute is commonly used by webpages to understand what the page is about and should be a
							max of 155 characters. It is sometimes displayed in search engine results. The
							<i>keywords</i> attribute is obviously keywords you want to be used to help find your
							webpage through the search engine. The <i>robots</i> tag is used to let a wepage know if it
							should add your page to the search results or not. A value of <i>noindex</i> can be used if
							you would not like the webpage to be indexed or added. A value of <i>nofollow</i> can be
							used if search engines should add this page in their results but not other pages that it
							links to.
						</p>

						<p>The <i>http-equiv</i> attribute is used by servers to gather information about a page using
							the HTTP header. The <i>author</i> attribute defines the author of the webpage. The
							<i>pragma</i> attribute prevents the browser from caching the page (saving it locally). The
							<i>expires</i> attribute can be used to let a page know when to expire since webpages are
							usually cached. There is a specific format for the expiration and will be in the
							&#60meta&#62 element for this page, inside the header. The &#60meta&#62 element is an empty
							element (meaning it does not need to have a closing tag).
						</p>

						<p>Escape characters are characters that are reserved for HTML coding so therefore must be
							created with special key phrases and codes. A list of any escape character needed can be
							found online if and when needed. Copyright symbols, trademark symbols, angled brackets etc.
							are examples of escape characters.</p>

				<h2 class="title">Flash, Video, and Audio</h2>

			</fieldset>

			<p>Flash is a very popular way to add animations, video, and audio to your website. In order to add a flash
				video to your website, it must be saved in a SWF (.swf file extension). When you export the video into
				.swf file format, flash creates a code that you can use to embed the flash video into your document or
				webpage. If using HTML, the &#60object&#62 and &#60embed&#62 tags are used. However it's more common to
				use Javascript.</p>

			<p>The most common way of adding Flash into a website is Javascript. You use scripts you can find from
				google in order to add flash without a super in-depth understanding of Javascript. The advantage of
				using this technique is that it allows browsers to show alternative content for users whose browsers do
				not support Flash.</p>

			<p>The &#60div&#62 element is used to create a space to identify where the Flash video should sit. The value
				of the &#60div&#62 element with its included <i>id</i> attribute is used by the SWFObject script. Inside
				the &#60div id&#62 element you should place alternative content for users who are not able to play Flash
				video. For users who cannot see Flash video, you should have a description or a still from the video
				instead.</p>

			<p>The SWFObject script will check to see if the users browser can play the Flash movie or video. If it can,
				the script will replace the &#60div&#62 element with the .swf file. (Your video)</p>

			<p>Using a text description as alternative content will achieve two benefits:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The text can be accessed by those with visual or physical disabilitys who are not able to see or
					interact with the Flash video. </li>
				<li>The text can be indexed by search engines (which do not effectively at the time this book was
					written index SWF files). Increasing the chance of your content being found.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>The <i>type</i> attribute is used on the &#60script&#62 element to indicate that the script inside is
				Javascript. The <i>src</i> attribute tells the browser where to find the script. The second
				&#60script&#62 element tells the browser information about the Flash movie itself, as well as which
				elements its going to replace.</p>

			<p>There are 5 pieces of information provided in the second &#60script&#62 element.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>The location of the .swf file is shown by: <b>flash/bird.swf</b></li>
				<li>The element that the Flash movie should replace, specified by the value of the <i>id</i> attribute
					given to the &#60div&#62 element: <b>bird</b></li>
				<li>The width of the Flash movie (which in this instance) is: <b>400</b> </li>
				<li>The height of the Flash move (which in this instance) is: <b>300</b></li>
				<li>The final piece of information provided is the minimun updated version of Flash player required to
					view the movie or video: <b>8.0.0</b></li>

			</ol>

			<p>Uploading videos to your website deals with video formats, browsers, and players/plugins. Browsers will
				accept some video formats but not all, so you may need to use a video converter to convert the format of
				your video. The process of converting your video is called "encoding". </p>

			<p>Not all browsers accept the same video formats, so you must supply your video in more than one format to
				reach the largest audience. The following combo of formatting methods will include the most amount of
				browers:</p>

			<ul>
				<b>H264:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>IE</li>
					<li>Safari</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<b>WebM:</b>

					<li>Android</li>
					<li>Google Chrome</li>
					<li>Firefox</li>
					<li>Opera</li>

			<p>The EASIEST way to upload a video to your website is an external video player source, such as Youtube or
				other video streaming services but has its own advantages and disadvantages. </p>

			<ul>
				<b>Advantages:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Online streaming services provide players that work with the maajority of web browsers.</li>
					<li>You don't have to worry about encoding your video since these websites allow you to upload your
						content is a wide variety of formats, once your video is uploaded, it is automatically converted
						to whatever format may be necessary by each individual browser.</li>
					<li>Web hosting companies typically charge extra if there is a lot of bandwidth used, and video
						files specifically can use a whole lot of bandwidth, so it may be extra cost to host the video
						on your own website. Whereas online streaming services don't charge you to host the video.</li>

				</ul>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<b>Disadvantages:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Your video will be on a streaming service available to anyone and everyone, therefore it will
						not be exclusive content. </li>
					<li>Some services (Youtube and such) will limit what you are allowed to put on your website. There
						may be specific guidelines per the website, but most services do not allow you to put ads on
						your videos in order to monetize it.</li>
					<li>Some services will put their own ads on the videos before they allow your video to play. Some
						services may overlap with your video and will play both the video and ad at the same time.</li>

				</ul>
			</ul>

			<p>Different browsers have different &#60controls&#62 of which the appearance can be changed (only through
				javascript). No attributes in the HTML5 &#60video&#62 element are required to carry a value. If the
				attribute is present, then the control is turned on, if the attribute isn't put into the code then it's
				not there. Simple. If the browser doesn't accept the format style used then only the text between then
				&#60video&#62 tags will be shown.</p>

			<p>Within the &#60video&#62 tag there are several attributes that may be used in order to control playback,
				they are as follows:</p>

			<dl>
				<dt><b><i>preload</i></b></dt>
				<dd>The preload attribute tells the page what to do when the page loads. It can have one of the three
					following values:</dd>
				<ul>
					<dl>
						<dt><i>none</i></dt>
						<dd>This will tell the browser not to load the video until the wesbite user presses play. </dd>

						<dt><i>auto</i></dt>
						<dd>The browser will download the video when the page loads with tht rest of the page.</dd>

						<dt><i>metadata</i></dt>
						<dd>The browser will only collect information such as the frame size, the first frame for a
							still photo, track list, and duration if applicable.</dd>

					</dl>
				</ul>

				<h4>Attributes inside of the &#60video&#62 tag:</h4>

				<dt><i>src</i></dt>
				<dd>The <i>src</i> attribute specifies (as usual and to be expected) the source of the move/video on
					your computer or otherwise located video/movie.</dd>

				<dt><i>poster</i></dt>
				<dd>The poster attribute allows you to display am image while the video is downloading or the user tells
					the video to play.</dd>

				<dt><i>width</i></dt>
				<dd>Set the width of the video in pixels (Should be the same size as the video is downloaded to your pc
					in)</dd>

				<dt><i>height</i></dt>
				<dd>Set the height of the video in pixels (Should be the same size as the video is downloaded to yout pc
					in)</dd>

				<dt><i>controls</i></dt>
				<dd>The <i>controls</i> attribute allows the browser to supply playback controls for the user to
					specify. </dd>

				<dt><i>autoplay</i></i></dt>
				<dd>When you use the <i>autoplay</i> attribute, the video will automatically play when the page is
					loaded. </dd>

				<!--Annoying as hell ^ -->

				<dt><i>loop</i></dt>
				<dd>When the <i>loop</i> attribute is used, it will specify that the video should automatically replay
					once it has ended.</dd>

				<dt><i>type</i></dt>
				<dd>The <i>type</i> attribute will tell the browser what format it is in. Otherwise it will download
					some of the video to see if it can play the file (takes time and bandwidth)</dd>

				<dt><i>codecs</i></dt>
				<dd>Codecs means a hardware or software based process that compresses and decompresses large amount of
					data. (In this case it's software.) Codecs are used in applications to play and create media files
					for users, as well as to sent media files over a network.The term is a blend of the words coder and
					decoder, as well as compresssion and decompression. The codec that was used to encode the video is
					supplied within the <i>type</i> attribute. Notice the use of single quotes and the double quotes,
					when the <i>type</i> attribute is used.</dd>


				<dt><b><i>&#60source&#62</i></b></dt>
				<dd>To specify within code where the location of a file is to be found, one should use the
					&#60source&#62 tag inside of the &#60video&#62 element. This will replace the <i>src</i> attribute
					on the opening &#60video&#62 tag. You can use multiple &#60&source#62 tags to specify that the video
					is available in different formats. (You should provide the MP4 format on the first &#60source&#62
					tag to prevent a bug that the Ipad has which won't allow the video to play otherwise.)</dd>

			</video>


			<h4><b>Adding Audio to your Webpages:</b></h4>

			<p>The &#60audio&#62 element is used (as you would expect) to add audio to your webpages. The same rule
				applies for both &#60video&#62 and &#60audio&#62 elements regarding formats, different browsers will
				expect different formats.</p>

			<dl>
				<dt><b><i>&#60audio&#62</i></b></dt>
				<dd>
					<!--I think you're supposed to leave the <dd> both opening and closing tags there even if there is no information to be shown about the above -->
				</dd>
				<ul>
					<dl>
						<dt><i>src</i></dt>
						<dd>This specifies the location of the file location on your computer. </dd>

						<dt><i>controls</i></dt>
						<dd>This will allow the player to show audio <i>controls</i> for the user. If the
							<i>controls</i> attribute is not supplied, there will be no audio <i>controls</i> shown
							by default. You can also indicate your own <i>controls</i> with Javascript.
						</dd>

						<dt><i>autoplay</i></dt>
						<dd>This will automatically play the designated audio as soon as the video loads. (Bad
							practice) Do not use, unless for a very specific application.</dd>

						<dt><i>preload</i></dt>
						<dd>This will indicate what the browser should do if the player is not set to autoplay. It
							can have the same values we seen on page 214 for the &#60video&#62 element. (None, Auto,
							and Metadata)</dd>

						<dt><i>loop</i></dt>
						<dd>The <i>loop</i> attribute will play the audio file again once it has finished.</dd>

					</dl>
				</ul>

				<p>This method only works in browsers that accept the <i>Ogg Vorbis</i> audio format (Firefox,
					Opera, and Google
					Chrome). In order to play the audio in Safari 5 and IE 9, the audio will need to be in an mp3
					format or just use the
					&#60source&#62 element (just like with the &#60video&#62 element) to indicate multiple audio
					formats.</p>

				<p>It's possible to specify multiple audio formats using the &#60source&#62 tag within the &#60audio&#62
					element instead of using the <i>src</i> attribute on the opening &#60audio&#62 tag. (Again,
					different browsers accept different formats which is why this is a necessary step.) </p>

				<h2 class="title">Introducing CSS </h2>

			</fieldset>

			<h4>Understanding CSS:</h4>

			<p>The easiest way to begin to understand CSS and how it works is to imagine that every element, (block or
				inline) element has a box around it specifying what should be styled. Here are some example styles of
				what
				can be styled within each type of element:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Boxes</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Width and Height</li>
						<li>Borders (Colors, width, and style).</li>
						<li>Background color and images.</li>
						<li>Position in the browser window.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Text</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Typeface</li>
						<li>Size</li>
						<li>Color</li>
						<li>Italics, bold, uppercase, lowercase, small-caps </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Specific</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Tables</li>
						<li>Graphs</li>
						<li>Lists</li>
						<li>Forms</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>CSS allows you to set parameters for multiple elements within one line of code. In other words, CSS rules
				are
				applied to different HTML elements as a whole in order to style them. Below is a beginner example of how
				CSS
				code is written in order to specify and edit inline and block elements:</p>

			<p><b>body</b> {
				<i>font-family: Arial, Verdana, Sans-Serif;}</i>
			</p>

			<p><b>h1, h2, h4</b> {
				<i>color: #2AE9D6;}</i>
			</p>

			<p><b>p</b> {
				<i>color: #EF0E0E;}</i>
			</p>

			<p>CSS code contains two seperate parts that makeup the code itself. A <b>selector</b> and
				<b>declaration</b>
				the <i>selector</i> indicates which element the rule applies to. The same rule can be applied to more
				than
				one element if you seperate the element names with commas as seen above. The <i>declaration</i>
				indicates
				how the elements referred to in the <i>selector</i> should be treated and styled. Declarations are split
				into two parts, <b>property</b> and <b>value</b>, which are seperated by a comma.</p>

			<p>Looking at the above code, the <b>property</b> is the word <i>color</i> and the <b>value</b> is the
				actual
				color code <i>#2AE9D6</i>. </p>

			<fieldset class="titlefs">

				<h2 class="title">Using External CSS</h2>

			</fieldset>

			<p>In order to use external CSS, a &#60link&#62 element must be used to tell the browser where to find the
				CSS
				styling for that specific webpage. The &#60link&#62 element is an empty element, meaning it does not
				have a
				closing tag. It also lives inside the &#60head&#62 element. The &#60link&#62 element should contain
				three
				seperate attributes:</p>


			<dl>

				<dt><b>href</b></dt>
				<dd>This specifies the path to the CSS file. (Often in a file named <i>CSS</i> or <i>Styles</i>)</dd>
				<dt><b>type</b></dt>
				<dd>This attribute specifies the type of file being linked to. (The value should always be
					<i>text/css</i>
					for a CSS file.)</dd>
				<dt><b>rel</b></dt>
				<dd>This dictates the relation between the HTML page and the file it is being linked to. The value
					should be
					<i>stylesheet</i> when linking to a CSS file.
				</dd>
			</dl>

			<p>Your HTML page can include multiple CSS style sheets. To do this, it could have a &#60link&#62 element
				for
				every CSS file it is utilizing. Some authors may use one CSS file to control the presentation (such as
				fonts
				and colors) and another CSS file to control the layout of the page.</p>

			<fieldset class="titlefs">

				<h2 class="title">Using Internal CSS</h2>

			</fieldset>

			<p>You can add CSS rules directly to your page by placing them inside a &#60style&#62 element which
				typically
				lives inside of a &#60head&#62 element of a page. The &#60style&#62 element should use the <i>type</i>
				attribute to specify that the styles are being specified with CSS, the value should be <i>text/css</i>
			</p>

			<p>When building a site with more than one webpage, you should always use an external CSS style sheet for
				the
				following reasons.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>It allows all pages to use the same style rules, rather than having to write out the code again
					seperately in every page.</li>
				<li>You can keep the content seperate from how the page looks.</li>
				<li>You can easily revise or edit all the content for all the pages at one time from one location rather
					than having to change every single page.</li>
			</ol>

			<fieldset class="titlefs">

				<h2 class="title">CSS Selectors</h2>

			</fieldset>

			<p>There are many selectors to allow you to specifically target any element in an HTML document. CSS
				selectors
				are case sensitive, so they must match the element names and attribute values exactly. There are more
				advanced selectors that allow you to select elements based on their attributes and values.</p>
