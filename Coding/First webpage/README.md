#First website
This is my first go at HTML and CSS self taught with the book HTML & CSS by Jon Duckett and online references, such as MDN web docs.
This is the same code as the parent folder. It's just a more organized file, as I don't want to delete my first repository but rather add to, in order to show improvement.
